        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Case Study: Strategy and</h1>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>Decisions in Perspective</u></h1>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;"><u>Case – Fashion Design Networks</u></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Of all the links of this chain, the clothing sector has great importance in the
foreign market, since it represented 45.4% of the total in 2000. It should thus
be stressed that the clothing industry responds for almost half of total exports
resulting from other links in the chain.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Management of trademarks, development of fashion design and product
concept, quality, and marketing became more and more important as critical
factors for the success of the brazilian textile industry. Companies adopting the
fashion vanguard as a competitive strategy try to distinguish their products,
responding rapidly to market signals and fostering creativity, innovation and
supply-chain management.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Each season, new collections with new fabrics, patterns, colors, and models
are introduced, affecting the whole textile and clothing supply chain. The
shorter the development cycle for new products, the greater the need to
intensify the relations along the supply chain, so as to make the sector aware
of the consumers’ needs.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, there is a need to be more flexible. However, it should also be stressed
that vanguard companies require that these chain linkages be willing to form
long-term partnerships, providing exclusive patterns and finishing in small lots
for each season, and trust and confidentiality are essential. These are mid to
large-sized companies that maintain a quite balanced and close relationship
with the hub company, involving joint development of new products (codesign).</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Although patterns of competition present great variation according to the sector
and consumer profile, it can be observed that the fashion vanguard companies
have been strengthening their own brands or licensing foreign brands trying to
obtain overseas markets. At the same time, these companies articulate a wide
outsourced network of companies and retail stores, supported by information
technology, with effective control of quality and delivery time. These companies,
considered vanguard, are responsible for the quick introduction of
product innovation in the brazilian market, in tune with the main fashion centers.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The hub companies give priority to product design, brand name, and marketing,
and the rest of the production process is done according to an outsourcing</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">system typical of this sector. In this system, there is a service supplier without
its own product line, working only under order for third parties. This service
supplier makes available facilities, equipments, and workforce, while the hub
firm provides all inputs and manufacture procedures. This kind of operation is
very common in the cut-and-sew phase that can be done by different service
suppliers. These suppliers are usually small, with close but standardized
relationships, with a high degree of asymmetry in their relationships with hub
firm and low bargaining power. The information system is basically done via the
Internet, since these companies have a low degree of information technology.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The selling is done by brand stores, with intensive use of franchising systems.
The brand is really a relevant issue for companies working with strategies. It
must give to the chosen market segment a strong identification, the feeling of
belonging to a given lifestyle (street, club, surfwear, etc.). Retailers play an
important role, since both architecture and decoration must impart the same
concept. Along with these factors, there is also the availability of a full line of
products, including products and accessories, promotional items, distinctive
packages, and media-covered events. Just as in the case of the service
suppliers, the franchise-holding companies receive the complete detailed
retailer project and are interconnected by an EDI information system. Franchisers
have frequent relations with the hub company, but it seems more like a
partnership, since they are important channels that should be kept close to the</p><br>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">The activities developed by the hub firm can be divided as follows: marketing

a vanguard hub company. The width of the arrows represents the intensity of

        <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Introduction</u></b></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Companies have undergone a process of transformation, organizing themselves
to be able to make effective and agile responses to environmental problems
and, especially, those having to do with competition and positioning in the
market. These responses constitute a set of actions or activities that reflect the
company’s competence in taking advantage of opportunities, and their capacity
for rapid action, respecting time and cost limits and specifications (Rabechini
& Carvalho, 2003). To do so, constructing project-oriented organizations and
investing in management design tools and techniques is fundamental, and this
has become a growing concern of companies.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Handy (1995) points out that organizations in the postindustrial era will be
configured like “condominiums”, with groups of projects housed together,
since what adds the most value to products and services are intelligent, rather
than routine, activities (Fleury & Fleury, 2000).</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">According to Frame (1999), project management practices have consolidated
since the 1990s, and several researchers cite this as an obligatory subject.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">matter for companies that seek to develop and maintain competitive advantages.
A good indicator of this growth is the presence of the PMI <i>(Project
Management Institute)</i>in over 100 countries; it has certified around 25,000
project managers since the beginning of 2002 (Rabechini and Carvalho, 2003).</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">However, studies based in Brazilian companies show that few have formalized
development of a management model for the process of innovation and projects
(Rabechini et al., 2002).</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The main concepts related to project management and the ways that a company
can structure itself to reach maturity in its projects will be discussed in this
chapter. The alignment between strategy and project management structure is
also addressed.</p>
      <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Project Concept</u></b></h1>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">For Rabechini, Jr. and Carvalho (1999), the concept of projects has been
refined in recent years in order to establish a common understanding in
organizations that work with this kind of undertaking.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">There are several definitions of “project” available in the literature.<i>ISO 10006
(1997) define project as a single process consisting of a group of coordinated
and controlled activities with a beginning and end date, undertaken
to achieve an objective, according to specific requirements, including
time, cost, and resource limitations. For Tuman (1983), a project is an
organization of dedicated people aiming to reach a specific purpose and
goal that usually involves costs, single actions, or high risk undertakings
which have to be complete by a certain date for an amount of money,
within some expectation for performance. Finally, PMI (2000) defines
project as 􀂳a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product,
service or a result."</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Two intrinsic concepts are perceptible in these definitions (Rabechine &
Carvalho, 2003):<i>the first one refers to temporality,</i>i.e., all projects have a
well-determined beginning and end; the second one refers to their<i>uniqueness
or singularity, i.e., that the product or service, in some way be different than
all those similar, accomplished earlier.</i></p>  
    <p>Even though not so explicit in all the definitions in Chart 1, the uncertainty and
complexity inherent to projects are also fundamental issues to comprehending</p>
    </div>

            <div class="side-heading">

        </div>
    </header>
      <div class="page">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">this concept. In this sense, Maximiano (1997) and Sabbag (1999) present
models which incorporate these issues.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In the model proposed by Sabbag (1999), these questions are dealt with by the
Cube of Uncertainty, which is comprised of three variables: complexity,
singularity, and precise objectives.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">This model evaluates and proposes distinct management strategies depending
on the type of project. According to Sabbag (1999), “different projects result
in different cubes. For example, a road building project or a typical building
construction, normally demonstrates high narrowness with regard to objectives
and lower complexity and singularity.” On the other hand, “A typical research
and development project or one to develop new software, can instead display
high singularity and complexity, but show low narrowness of objectives”
(Rabechini & Carvalho, 2003).</p>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">For Maximiano (1997), projects can be divided into four large categories
according to their uncertainty and complexity. The higher degree of unknown,
the greater the uncertainty and the greater the associated risk. Complexity can
be evaluated through the degree of multi-disciplinarily needed for project
execution, the diversity and volume of information to be processed, and the
number of organizations involved, among other aspects.</p>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Organizational Structures</b></h1>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b><u>and the Project</u></b></h1>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;"><u>Organizational Structures</u></h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">According to Patah and Carvalho (2002), organizational structure should be
dynamic, i.e., capable of rapid changes if the environment demands them.
External factors involved can be an increase in competition in the market niche,
a change in technology, or even the unpredictability of demand.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The traditional organization, called functional, is marked by divisions by
departments, and displays some positive aspects, such as greater controllability
and minimal internal conflict. Each department displays high technical dominion
and facilitated internal communications, since each functionary reports to a
director. Nevertheless, with the growing diversification demanded by the</p>

    <div class="page">
      <p style="text-align: justify;">market, it has become ever more difficult to manage projects inside companies
with functional organization, since this system tends to serve the point of view
of a department and not the point of view of the client.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Projectized and matrix structures arose as an alternative to the rigidity of the
functional organizational structure. The matrix structure is a combination of the
functional and project structures and can be divided into weak, balanced, and
strong matrix (Patah & Carvalho, 2002). The main advantages and disadvantages
of these two structures are summarized in Table 4.1.</p>

      <div class="page">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">According to Kerzner (2001), in order to choose the most appropriate
organizational structure to organize project activity, some factors that influence
the decision should be considered: project size, duration, the organization’s
experience in managing projects, the philosophy of the company’s upper
management regarding project management, the physical location of the
project, available resources, and specific project aspects.</p>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">Meredith and Mantel (2000) summed up the process of choosing an organizational
structure for a project in six steps:</p><br>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">1. Define the specific results desired from the project;</p>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">2. Determine the key tasks for achieving the defined results and identify
which company departments need to be involved;</p>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">3. Sequence and group key tasks in a logical fashion;</p>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">4. Determine to which project subsystem the task groups will be allocated;</p>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">5. Identify special project and company features that affect the manner in
which the project should be organized;</p>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">6. Consider the above information in making the final decision in relation to
the pros and cons of each type of organizational structure.</p><br>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">When the organizational structure is not selected in an appropriate manner,
several problems can be diagnosed. According to Patah and Carvalho (2002b)
some factors are indicative of problems, such as: projects don’t manage to meet
time, cost, and other requirements; experts feel under-utilized; no one takes
responsibility when the project tends toward failure; among others.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Mintzberg and Heyden (1999) warn, however, that organizational charts
sometimes do not adequately reflect how people really organize at work. These
authors present a new kind of organizational mapping called the <i>organigraph</i>
which introduces new components called <i>hubs</i> and <i>webs</i>, in addition to the
already used set and chain, as described in Figure 4.1.</p>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">For these authors, the new components —<i>hubs</i> and <i>webs</i> — can be defined
in the following way:</p>
       <p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"A hub serves as a coordinating center. It is any physical or
conceptual point at which people, things, or information move."</i></p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><i>"Webs...are grids with no center; they allow open-ended communication

      <h2 style="text-align: left;"><u>Project Management Office (PMO)</u></h2>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to thinking about structure in the context of each project, the PMO
<i>(Project Management Office)</i> is a structure intended to apply project
management concepts within the organization and can take on various functions.
The PMO can greatly aid the transformation of a company’s strategies
into project management. Rollins (2003a) estimates that there are more than
50,000 PMOs of some type in the USA.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">The PMO can be defined as an organizational entity established to aid project
managers and organizational teams in implementing principles, practices,
methodologies, tools, and techniques for project management (Daí, 2001).</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Verzuh (1999) argues that if an organization only occasionally manages
projects, there is no need to develop systematic abilities for project efforts.
However, if an organization devotes a large part of its energy to project
implementation, an inconsequential approach to project management leads to
inefficiencies and can even be dangerous. With a larger number of projects
being managed, the need for a PMO becomes more evident.</p>

      <div class="page">
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Four evolutions of the PMO model are proposed by Dinsmore (1998), Project
Support Office (PSO), Project Management Center of Excellence (PMCOE),
Program Management Office (PrgMO) and the Chief Project Officer (CPO).
These models run from a simple sector to help project control (PSO) to a
company department where all projects managed by the organization pass
through (Patah et al., 2003).</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">When an organization undertakes autonomous projects, the project management
function stays within the project itself. The source of information on
project-management practices, in this case, comes from earlier experience and
that of the project leaders. All costs for the project team are allocated to the
project. The organization does not provide support and all project management
functions are realized by the project team itself. The function of this kind of
PMO is to manage the project in all its integrity. Thus, total responsibility for
project success resides with the project manager.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">The PSO provides technical and administrative support, tools and services to
various project managers simultaneously, aiding in planning, programming, and
dealing with changes of scope and in managing costs of the projects. The
resources involved, both internal and external, are allocated to the projects
depending on the nature and contractual structure of each. Sometimes PSO
personnel are loaned to a project during its start up phase or even for the longterm.
Responsibility for project success does not lie with the PSO, but with the
project managers who use its services.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">The Project Management Center of Excellence is a focal point for project
experience, but does not take on responsibility for results. It appears as a
general overhead expense, which is not allocated directly to projects. To a
large extent, the task of the PMCOE is of a missionary nature: to disseminate
ideas, convert non-believers, and transform followers into professionals, who
are imbued with the methodologies. The center keeps the channels of communication
open between the projects and the community outside of project
management.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">The Program Management Office manages the project managers and is, in the
last instance, responsible for project results. In large corporations, the PrgMO
concentrates its efforts on the priority projects. Other projects are managed by
departments or units, and receive support from the PrgMO as needed. By
nature, the PrgMO encompasses the functions of the PMCOE and, in some
cases, of the PSO. For a PrgMO to function adequately, power, corporate
priority, and control over the business environment are necessary.</p>

     <div class="page">
       <p style="text-align:justify;">The CPO’s responsibility is to care for and nourish the company’s project
portfolio from the stage of business decision through final implementation.
Among its activities, the CPO is responsible for the following: involvement in
business decisions that result in new projects; strategic business planning;
establishing priorities and negotiating resources for projects; supervising the
implementation of strategic projects; assuming responsibility for the project
management system at the company level; development of sensitization and
project management capacities throughout the organization; periodic project
evaluations, including the decision to discontinue them; managing the high level
stakeholders; and facilitation and mentoring.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">Verzuh (1999) also presents a classification of five different types of PMO:</p><br>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">• Center for Excellence;</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">• Project Support Office;</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">• Project Management Office;</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">• Program Management Office;</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">• Accountable Project Office.</p><br>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">The main purpose of a center of excellence is to maintain standards for project
management and to promote their use in the organization. Despite the team
frequently being called upon to lend consultation, it does not have a direct role
in decision-making about the project. Instead, its authority within the organization
derives almost exclusively from its knowledge of project management
abilities. This means that, in addition to their knowledge, team members also
have to be capable agents of change, persuasively offering advice to members
of the organization at all levels.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to maintaining and promoting project management standards and
practices, the <i>project support office (PSO)</i> actively support a number of
projects by, for example, creating and updating the project plan or its budget.
Made up of planning analysts, the PSO is responsible for maintaining exact
control while having responsibility for decisions about profit and loss. These
planning analysts often become project managers. This means that contributing
more project managers to the organization’s pool of talent is another contribution
of the PSO.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">A<i>project management office</i> (PMO) can offer support in creating schedules
and budgets in the same way as a PSO. The main difference is that the PMO</p>

    </header>
      <div class="page">
        <p style="text-align:justify;">will provide project managers for all the organization’s projects. Thus the PMO
becomes a long-term base for those who want to make a career in project
management. Due to being made up of many project managers, the PMO is able
to reinforce project management standards. Despite PMOs being responsible
for managing the salaries and professional growth of their project managers,
they are not responsible for the success or failure of the project. This
responsibility lies with the organization to which the project manager is
allocated. On the other hand, if a company develops a series of failed projects,
the PMO will also be held responsible, since it is the source of the company’s
knowledge of project management.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">Programs are a series of related projects. The main difference is that programs
are so long that they develop some operational routines inside themselves. The
role of the program management office is to provide knowledge in project
management for the entire program, through the union of all projects together.
The large program management office will have teams that carry out various
project management functions such as scheduling, budgeting, and risk management.
Like the PSO, the program management office is not directly responsible
for meeting schedules and budgets; its role is mostly putting good
management practices and projects into use and then supporting them. Differently
than the PSO, the program management office participates in project
decision-making. In contrast to the other form of project office, the program
management office has a use life, i.e. it will be dismounted after the project is
finished.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>accountable project office</i> is the oldest, but in some cases, the most
radical model of <i>project office</i>. Despite its being commonly referred to simply
as the project office it is called the <i>accountable project office</i> to distinguish
it from the other forms presented. It is called this because it has total
responsibility for scheduling and for the quality and cost goals of the projects
delegated to it. Like the project management office, it is a long-term sector for
project managers, providing them with a career model and administrative
management. It is made up of project managers and project support personnel.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">It is worth stressing that, even though the PMO models appear to be
evolutionary, they can have a stronger adherence to a specific type of
organization depending on the role of project management in the type of
corporate strategy.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;">It would be a mistake to think of the various <i>project</i> office forms as a
progression that all companies should follow. This would suggest that a center
for excellence is only the beginning and that the natural and proper evolution.</p>
